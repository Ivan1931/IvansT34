The robocode bot that won the 2013 Wits University Robocup competition.

This code is quite badly written as I was in a rush. Lots of smells, kludges and bloat. 
This bot uses a semi-random movement algorithm with a K-nearest neighbour 
to create zones of movement exclusion. Also uses linear targeting for its aiming system.

A good bot but will be destroyed by proper bots.
